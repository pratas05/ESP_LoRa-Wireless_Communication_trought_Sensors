# Lora Sensor Project

## Overview
This project is designed to interface with a LoRa sensor for collecting and transmitting data over long distances using LoRaWAN technology. It provides a robust solution for IoT applications such as environmental monitoring, smart agriculture, and industrial automation.

## Features
- **LoRaWAN Communication**: Long-range, low-power wireless communication.
- **Sensor Integration**: Supports various sensors for data collection.
- **Data Logging**: Logs sensor data locally or transmits it to a cloud server.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Optimized for battery-powered devices.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable for additional sensors or features.

## Requirements
- LoRa module (e.g., SX1276, RFM95)
- Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32, Arduino)
- Sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure)
- Power source (e.g., battery or USB)
- LoRaWAN gateway (optional for cloud integration)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Lora_sensor.git
    cd Lora_sensor
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    - For Arduino: Install required libraries via the Arduino Library Manager.
    - For PlatformIO: Run `pio lib install` to install dependencies.

3. Flash the firmware to your microcontroller:
    ```bash
    pio run --target upload
    ```

## Usage
1. Connect the LoRa module and sensors to your microcontroller as per the wiring diagram.
2. Configure the `config.h` file with your LoRaWAN credentials and sensor settings.
3. Power on the device and monitor the serial output for debugging.
4. Deploy the device in the desired location for data collection.

## Configuration
Edit the `config.h` file to set:
- LoRaWAN keys and credentials
- Sensor types and pins
- Data transmission intervals
